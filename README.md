his project focuses on analyzing U.S. domestic flight data using Power BI, Python, and MySQL, aiming to identify key insights into airline performance, delays, and cancellations.
 Tools Used
Python (Pandas, Seaborn) for data cleaning, preprocessing, and EDA

MySQL for structured data storage and query attempts

Power BI for interactive visualization and dashboard creation
Dashboard Highlights (Power BI)
Airline-wise Arrival Time and Delay distribution

Taxi-in, Late Aircraft Delay, and Scheduled Arrival indicators

Cancellations analyzed by reasons

Flight Distance vs Elapsed Time vs Diversions

City & Country-based metrics (Latitude, Arrival Time)
Key Insights
WN (Southwest Airlines) recorded the highest arrival time volume

Major delays were caused by Late Aircraft and system issues

Cancellations were mostly under reason ‘B’, indicating carrier-related causes

Top cities with high flight traffic: Portland, Chicago, New York

A strong correlation observed between distance flown and elapsed flight time
